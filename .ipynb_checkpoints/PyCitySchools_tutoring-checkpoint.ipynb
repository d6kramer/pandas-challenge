    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- After reviewing the data, there are three observations I would like to highlight in detail: The performance of Charter vs District schools, focusing on the problem of school size instead of assuming more money will fix a school's performance, and acknowledging the gap between Math and Reading scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Charter Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to this data, our cities Charter schools vastly outperform our District schools. While average scores in both math and reading stay within an eight point range, the disparity is much clearer when studying the percentage of students passing out of each school type. Here, we see that District schools appear to be failing our students most particularly with their math studies, where a nearly 30-point gap exists between the Charter and District schools. When combined with a nearly 16-point gap for students passing their reading test results, this yields an astonishing nearly 37-point gap for District students' passing percentage for standardized tests! It is clear to any parents within our school district that they should endeavor to send their child to a Charter school. I believe further analysis below will highlight some potential advantages Charter schools enjoy that may explain their ability to produce such positive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Money Doesn't Solve Everything\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a common refrain from educators, administrators, and public officials that the reason the education system continues to experience negative trends in student test score outcomes is due to a lack of adequate funding. Interestingly, the data collected for our city's school district points to a different culprit - school size! In fact, analysis of tha data reveals that many of our high performing Charter schools (as outlined above) are outperforming their District peers while also operating on a reduced per capita basis. In fact, half of our Charter schools are operating on a budget of less than 585 dollars per student, which is about 65 dollars less per student than some of our most well-funded District schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- When looking at the size of student populations, however, we see a notable difference in performance; all but one of our Charter schools fall into a small or mid-sized category (under 2,000 students), while all District schools serve 2,000+ students. This could indicate that even with more funding per student available in the District schools, we need to re-evaluate how those dollars are being spent. It is likely that smaller student populations allow for smaller class sizes and more one-to-one instructional time for students in our Charter schools; we should investigate reappropriating funds in our District schools to achieve smaller class sizes where possible, perhaps by hiring more instructors. Another option would be to build additional District schools to help disperse the student population, but this may not be a feasible solution for our timescale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Math Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "- While reviewing the school district data, I could not help but notice a large disparity across the entire student population regarding math vs. reading scores. While Charter schools certainly narrow the gap between subjects, I find it interesting that our District schools, despite their poor overall passing performance, are not horribly behind in their reading achievements. I believe this should be celebrated as a win, and helps us to focus our energy on our District schools' math departments. This could include seeking out additional staff to help with class sizes; possible incentive structures for math department staff to stoke progress toward achievement goals; targeted spending for math curriculum and supplies; and funding programs between Charter and District schools to help lower performing schools learn from their peers at better performing Charter schools. While I do think reading scores could benefit from improvement, I believe the fastest way to improve our school district overall would be to focus on Math test outcomes within our District schools.\n",
